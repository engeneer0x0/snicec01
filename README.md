Andoird Application for #Space_apps_Challenge #Food_Directions 

This project is solving the Food Directions challenge.
Description

 World hunger is an universal problem and Africa is the most continent affected. Our challenge is to build an application to make complicated data and statistics, readable  and fun for all people. In order to bring  empathy to our cause  and make general awareness for  people who don't know  what's happening in the other side of the planet, We've dug  in every piece of statistics and  ambiguous   data ,  we  learned  how to  give it an amazing graphic diagrams and interesting  maps,  then we had thoughts of developing a forum to make people around the world  discuss with each other and  try to find a way to solve their problems . 
<span>In it's final form , This app gives the user the best experience to explore  every African country information  and show him simplified  diagrams and maps  with every basic information ,  more than that  in the process to make the user empathizes with  the hunger kids,  we gave him chance to  donate a symbolic  amount of money via  non-national organizations  .
